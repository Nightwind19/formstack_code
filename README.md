# formstack_code
A form website following the CRUD methods. 

I used a multipage application instead of a single page application. I use Windows 10 and was not able to use the VagrantFile included, but I was able to extract the information in the files and set up the site on my WAMP. The PHPUnit tests are to check the variables and what they are returning. I did use composer and Git on my computer.
